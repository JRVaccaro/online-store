Online Store
## Description of the Project

- This is a simple Java console app that lets users shop from a list of products. You can add items to your cart, view or remove them, and check out when you're ready. It reads products from a file and handles basic input and payments.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to see a home screen with clear options, so that I know what actions I can take.
- As a user, I want to see a list of products that are available, so that I can choose which product to buy.
- As a user, I want to view the items in my cart, so that I can see what I’m buying and how much it will cost in total.
- As a user, I want to check out and purchase my items so that I can complete my order and receive the products.
- As a user, I want to have an exit option in the menu, so that I can close the application when I’m finished.
## Setup

You’ll be prompted to choose from the following options:

- Show Products: View the available products and add items to your cart by entering their ID.

- Show Cart: See what’s in your cart, remove items if needed, and choose to check out.

- Exit: Leave the application.
